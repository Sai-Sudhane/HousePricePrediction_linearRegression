# HousePricePrediction_linearRegression
🏠 House Price Prediction Project 📈

I'm thrilled to share the results of a recent machine learning project I've been working on! Using linear regression, we developed a model to predict house prices based on various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

🔹 Dataset:HousePricePrediction.csv
🔹 Key Contributions: Data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
🔹 Results: [Mention any significant results or insights gained]

This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world problem. I learned a lot about data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation metrics along the way.

Big thanks to my amazing team for their support and collaboration on this project. If you're interested in learning more about our process or the details of the project, feel free to reach out! 🚀
